# Phase Induced Compressive Sensing
This repo is collection of phase retrieval algorithms for use in holographic optical tweezer systems. All of the algorithms can be found in the algorithms.py file.

## Demo
If you would like to see a demo of how to use the functions in this repo, you can either clone the repo or copy the algorithms.py and main.py files into a folder. You can then run the main.py file and it will calculate an initial phase mask using the weighed Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm and then calculate a displaced version of this phase mask using the Phase Induced Compressive Sensing algorithm. Finally it will display the phase mask using matplotlib.
